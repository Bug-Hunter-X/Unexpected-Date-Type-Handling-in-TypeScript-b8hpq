# Unexpected Date Type Handling in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a potential issue related to how TypeScript handles the `Date` object in a function's return type. The example illustrates a scenario where there might be unexpected behavior based on how dates are stringified or displayed.

## Bug Description

The code showcases a function `greet` that takes a person's name and a `Date` object as input. It constructs a greeting message using template literals and `date.toDateString()`.  While seemingly straightforward, the implicit type conversion and potential variations in date formatting across different environments could lead to unexpected results or runtime errors.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly specifying the return type of the function as `string` and handling potential errors or edge cases related to date formatting.  This enhances the code's robustness and clarity.
